1. I would say that they both have their advantages. One thing  I noticed was that Loess would more accurately follow the
majority of the data. Thus, it would leave out a few up top and bottom. However, Kalaman would do a better job of trying to include
all values. For this particular assignment, I believe that Loess got the better output as it looks a little more tighter and concise compared
to kalman. Also, sometimes extra out of the ordinary values may not be needed. Thus, Loess is the better option


2. The Degrees and speed can help predict the location as speed in m/s can help provide a time and the degrees of direction
can provide a path the person in walking in.  Time tells you how long it's been, and speed and direction help figure out where you might go 
next. The degrees and speed can help predict the location since speed in m/s provides a time estimate, and the direction 
shows the path the person is walking. For example, if someone is walking north at a steady speed, we can guess they will be farther north 
 in a certain amount of time. However, changes in speed or direction make predicting the exact location tricky in real life.
